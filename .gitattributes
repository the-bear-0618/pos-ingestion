# Set default behavior for all files to handle line endings automatically.
# This ensures that on Windows, files are checked out with CRLF, and on
# Mac/Linux, they are checked out with LF. On commit, they are all
# normalized to LF in the repository.
* text=auto

# Explicitly declare file types that should always have LF line endings.
# This is critical for files that might be run in a Linux environment
# (like shell scripts or files used in Docker containers).
